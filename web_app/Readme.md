# Social Choice Lab: Project 3
# Web application

## Javascript project 
- Presents the results of the algorithm in readable and clear format. 
- Uses [Map API] (https://www.mapbox.com) to visualize different district partitions.

## Steps:
1. Install nodeJS and npm
2. ''' npm install '''
3. Change the state to the desired one in the [configuration file](config/default.json) (you can find list of ready states in ../states folder - the name you write in config shoud be the same as in states folder). Here you can also change the port number in case the default port the app uses (3001) is busy in your host.
4. ''' npm run dev '''
5. On your browser (preferably Chrome or Safari) go to localhost:3001 (or your port if yu changed it in the configuration file)
