# Social Choice Lab: Project 2, Neighbours Finder and Algorithm
## Javascript project
- Finds precincts neighbours for each precinct in provided geojson file 
- Execute the algorithm that finds a different partition of precincts s.t the goal defined in configuration file is achoeved.


## Steps:
1. Install nodeJS and npm

3. Change the [configuration file](config/default.json) with your configuration (you can find the description inside configuration file under "_comment" key)
4. ```node server.js```

:thought_balloon:\:
Two possible algorithm configurations can be found [here](config/algorithmConfig) and there is the "_comment" key to help you to match the algorithm to your needs
